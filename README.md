## Introduction and goal
For many DIY projects automated 2D and 3D modifications on materials are useful. For example:
* Markings for assembly and manual machining
* Markings for esthetics (artwork, UI)
* Cutting of sheet materials
* Milling of (small) metal objects
* 3D printing of small and medium sized plastics

All these modifications require at least a XY translation, and some also a Z translation. However, the required torque, speed and precision for the different applications varies a lot. In oder to design a product that is upto the task for all applications the extremes of each application has to be defined, and research is needed to make choices regarding feasibility and cost. In the section [Requirements](#requirements) a study of requirements for each application is made, starting with milling which requires the most torque and precision. In the development sections the [platform development](#dev-platform) and sub-unit developments are described. In later stages [Engineering](#eng) sections will be added for mechanical, electrical and
